# JAVA PASSWORD GENERATOR (JPG)
JPG is my first encounter with Spring Security, Spring Security OAuth2, JWT, React, and GCP.\
The main idea behind this project is not only to generate passwords easily,\
but also to store them in a convenient location.\
Additionally, I was eager to explore user registration and authentication methods.

While developing this project, the most challenging aspect was creating a user-friendly interface,\
as I had no prior experience with JavaScript. Difficulties also arose during authentication via Google;\
for some reason, the Axios library was reluctant to redirect users to the Google account selection form,\
making this feature currently unavailable.

Certainly, there are drawbacks, and addressing them is part of my near-future plans in other projects.


## Library that I used:
- react-router-dom
- react-toastify
- axios
- react-wavify
